    detail: Another rewrite, this app was originally written as an Android app as a gift for my father who trades covered calls. The original app was scraping websites for data, but after a few months of looking around, I was able to find the Tradier API and leverage it to supply the data I needed. <br/>The biggest challenge on the Meteor project was understanding the stock market and its terminology enough to calculate potential profits, implied volatilities, and probabilities of each stock reaching or maintaining a value at various price points and call dates. Another server-side challenge was scheduling the app to auto-update the database with new information at regular intervals. <br/>On the Android side, I got experience in retrieving data from my Meteor backend over DDP, as opposed to HTTP.

#    i18n: company_a
  desc:
    detail: P-delta was looking for a system to manage and track their projects, but didn't have a workflow conducive to systemization. I met with ownership multiple times during the process, going over ideas for a new workflow system that would eventually become the app. When we were finished, the app was able to track in what stage a project was while also dramatically cutting down the amount of data input with which they were originally consumed.

    detail: First paid Android project: EasterNow
#    i18n: company_a
  desc:
    detail: Available on the Play Store, EasterNow was an opportunity for me to code in tandem with a developer working on an iOS app at the same time. It was a great look into the challenge and complexity that arises when working in multiple teams on the same base product. I was also able to tackle challenges such as managing Realm objects across multiple threads and user testing on a wide variety of phones and Android versions.

#    i18n: company_a
  desc:
    detail: As Meteor and its community matured, it became clear that React would become the community-preferred front end library. To learn React, I decided to recreate one of my first few Android apps in Meteor.

    detail: First paid Meteor project: Wrapapp
#    i18n: company_a
  desc:
    detail: My previous company, WrapTX, needed a better way to track projects and manage client  interactions - wholesale and retail. To that end, I started development on a Meteor application. The app handles CRM, Project Management, Estimates and Invoicing, and Calendar scheduling by task category. To handle staff/broker/client complexity, I sought out and implemented a Meteor-specific account roles library to make sure data displayed accurately for each role.

    detail: First paid Grails project: Swaddling Clothes
#    i18n: company_a
  desc:
    detail: Swaddling Clothes, a charity program run in various congregations of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod to help their neighbors with the gifts of clothing, food, and friendship, expressed a need for an internal database to track and centrally report inventory and clientele. I worked on a team of two to develop a webapp to meet - and exceed - their requirements. I was able to learn about deployment configurations for Java webapps, particularly for Heroku, during this process. I was also exposed to the challenge of configuring Grails to use PostgreSQL to meet Heroku standards.
