  desc: Android, iOS, and Web Developer <br/><br/> I've been developing applications for 3 years, and while I enjoy designing great experiences, my true passion lies in learning new ways to solve problems. <br/><br/>I can be found working on my (too many) side projects or pestering friends and family members with fun logic puzzles, puns, and dad jokes in my spare time  # Describe yourself.
